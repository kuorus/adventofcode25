# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 Solutions (Python) 🐍

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2025** challenges.

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles that appear each December.

## ⚙️ Description

All solutions are written in **Python**. Each day's solution is contained within its own folder and file (e.g., `d01/day01.py`). The input data for each puzzle is expected to be placed in a corresponding file (e.g., `test.dat` for samples and `input.dat` for real input).

## ▶️ How to Execute the Solutions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kuorus/adventofcode25.git
    cd adventofcode25
    ```

2.  **Ensure you have Python installed** (Python 3.x is required).

3.  **Place the puzzle input:**
    Download your specific input data for the day you want to run from the Advent of Code website and save it as `input.dat` in the `dXX` folder (where `XX` is the day number).

4.  **Run the script for a specific day:**
    Execute the Python file for the day you wish to test:

    ```bash
    # Example for Day 01
    cd d01
    python day01.py
    ```

    The script will read the input file, process the puzzle, and print the resulting answers for Part 1 and Part 2.
